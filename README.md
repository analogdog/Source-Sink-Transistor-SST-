# Source-Sink-Transistor (SST)
This repository contains the engineering files and descriptions for a novel transistor configuration
known as the Source Sink Transistor (SST).
Here you will find the schematics and PCB design files for two different revisions of the design.
There are also user guides and a brief circuit description. 
The SST was developed for use in the Open Sourcemeter project.
